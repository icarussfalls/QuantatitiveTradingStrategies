Day 1 of #CreatingQuantitativeStrategiesforNepse

Today, I focused on debugging my scrapper tool to efficiently collect stock trade data. The code often crashed due to page load times, so I implemented several fixes.

Steps Taken:
- Set up Selenium with ChromeDriver for browser automation.
- Implemented a web scraper to gather essential stock data, including Date, LTP, Volume, and Turnover.
- Iterated through multiple pages of stock data.
- Saved the collected data into CSV format for future analysis.

This foundational work paves the way for analyzing historical stock trends in the Nepalese market as we advance toward more complex models.


Day 2 of #CreatingQuantitativeStrategiesforNepse
Today, I created a backtesting tool accounting for 3 day minimum holding period and 0.1% broker commission.
Simulated trades on API stocks using MACD and RSI signals and combined these strategies.
MACD remained a strong with 7x returns but it has higher volatility. (Sharpe of 0.77)
RSI has bad metrics across the board.

Day 3: Creating Quantitative Strategies for NEPSE 🌟

Today, I made significant strides in my journey to develop quantitative trading strategies for the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE). Used AI to improve the readability of the code.

🔍 Batch Scraping: I enhanced my data collection process by implementing batch scraping techniques, allowing me to gather floorsheet trading data for multiple stock symbols in one go. This not only saves time but also enables a more comprehensive analysis of market trends.

💻 Key Highlights:
Automated data extraction using Selenium and Python.
Inputting date ranges to collect historical floorsheet trading data systematically.
Efficiently managing multiple stock symbols in a single scraping session.
📈 The data collected will be instrumental in developing robust quantitative models and strategies tailored for NEPSE. Excited to see where this journey leads!
