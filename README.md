Day 1 of #CreatingQuantitativeStrategiesforNepse

Today, I focused on debugging my scrapper tool to efficiently collect stock trade data. The code often crashed due to page load times, so I implemented several fixes.

Steps Taken:
- Set up Selenium with ChromeDriver for browser automation.
- Implemented a web scraper to gather essential stock data, including Date, LTP, Volume, and Turnover.
- Iterated through multiple pages of stock data.
- Saved the collected data into CSV format for future analysis.

This foundational work paves the way for analyzing historical stock trends in the Nepalese market as we advance toward more complex models.


Day 2 of #CreatingQuantitativeStrategiesforNepse
Today, I created a backtesting tool accounting for 3 day minimum holding period and 0.1% broker commission.
Simulated trades on API stocks using MACD and RSI signals and combined these strategies.
MACD remained a strong with 7x returns but it has higher volatility. (Sharpe of 0.77)
RSI has bad metrics across the board.
